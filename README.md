# CatMull-Rom-Spline
GUI project implementing CatMull-Rom Spline with all the functionality a user may want!

## Setup
This is a visual studio 2019 project and should work with most recent VS version without any problems.

## Hot-Keys and Functionality
1. `H` - Start/Restart spline
2. `Ctrl+Z` - Undo points while drawing
3. `Esc` - Stop
4. `LMouse` - Select and move points anywhere
5. `Ctrl + LMouse` - Add spline point anywhere
6. `Delete` - Delete any selected point
7. `Slider` - Change the spline resolution

## Mathematical jargon
I have implemented type of **Cardinal Spline** called **CatMull-Rom Spline**. Thanks to excellent explanation by Robert Dunlop. [Here](http://www.mvps.org/directx/articles/catmull/) you can find the equations I have used to make this spline demonstration possible.
