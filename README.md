# CatMull-Rom-Spline
GUI project implementing CatMull-Rom Spline with all the functionality a user may want!

## Mathematical jargon
I have implemented type of **Cardinal Spline** called **CatMull-Rom Spline**. Thanks to excellent explanation by Robert Dunlop. [Here](http://www.mvps.org/directx/articles/catmull/) you can find the equations I have used to make this spline demonstration possible.
